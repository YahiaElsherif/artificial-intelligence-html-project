    <h3>Applications of Artificial Intelligence </h3>

    <img src="https://race.reva.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/infographics.png"
    width="400" height="400"> The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can
    be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and
    used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in
    patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room. Other examples
    of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess
    and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of
    any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess,
    the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system
    must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents
    a collision. Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial
    industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance
    such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help
    a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help
    streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand,
    and pricing of securities easier to estimate.
