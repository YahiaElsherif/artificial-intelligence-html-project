    width="400" height="200"> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence
    in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
    The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated
    with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. The ideal characteristic
    of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that
    have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence
    is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can
    automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.
    Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption
    of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.
